Chrysalis 0.3.0
===============
**UNRELEASED**

## UI/UX changes

The user interface underwent a major overhaul, in an attempt to follow the
Material Guidelines more closely. The new interface should be simpler, cleaner,
and more discoverable. We have also worked a lot on the various messages
displayed, to have them provide better guidance.

## New features

### Layer copying

It is now possible to copy one layer to another, making it easier to start from
the built-in, read-only layers: we no longer have to manually recreate them on a
writeable layer, but can start from a copy. Additionally, layers can also be
cleared, would we want to start afresh.

Both the layout and the colormap editor supports these.

### Modifier-augmented keys

We already had UI in place for showing modifier-augmented keys, such as
`Shift+2`, but the controls were disabled - they no longer are. We can now put
keys on the keymap with modifiers applied to them.

### Canceling pending changes

When there are unsaved, pending changes, the top bar will change color, and the
main menu turns into a cancel button. This allows us to undo any unsaved changes
we made, and refresh the state from the keyboard.

### Localisation

Chrysalis can now be translated, and is available in English and Hungarian.

### Debugging and developer tools

We made it easier to toggle the developer tools, in case something goes wrong (Chrysalis is alpha software!): pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` will bring up the console.

## New hardware support

The [ErgoDox EZ][ergodox:ez] (and any other ErgoDox that is compatible with the
original) is now also supported.

### Default firmware

For all hardware that does not come with Kaleidoscope as its default firmware,
we no longer require them to be flashed with Kaleidoscope prior to using
Chrysalis. Instead, we offer a firmware upgrade, with reasonable defaults - just
like we do for boards that do come with Kaleidoscope by default.

## Hardware support

Chrysalis now supports the [Atreus][atreus] keyboard, when it is running a
Chrysalis-enabled [Kaleidoscope][kaleidoscope] firmware. We ship with
[one][chrysalis-bundle:atreus], just in case.

 [atreus]: https://atreus.technomancy.us/
 [kaleidoscope]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope
 [chrysalis-bundle:atreus]: https://github.com/keyboardio/Chrysalis-Firmware-Bundle/tree/master/Technomancy/Atreus

Chrysalis also has preliminary support for [Dygma Raise][raise] - it should
work, but it is untested on real hardware at this time.

## UI/UX changes

* The dropdown on the keyboard selection page will now list not only the ports,
  but which keyboard they belong to, too.
* The previous "Information" page was replaced by a bottom bar, providing the
  same functionality, in a more accessible place.
